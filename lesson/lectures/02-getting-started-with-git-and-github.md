# getting started with git and github

## introduction

Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Torvalds—the same person who created Linux. Git is similar to other version control systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.

A repository (usually abbreviated to “repo”) is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored. Each project has its own repo, and you can access it with a unique URL.

GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. Microsoft, the biggest single contributor to GitHub, initiated an acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion in June, 2018.

_GitHub can be thought of as a serious social networking site for software developers. Members can follow each other, rate each other's work, receive updates for specific projects and communicate publicly or privately._

## git basics

- ### forking a repo

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

- ### cloning a repo

Cloning is a process of creating an identical copy of a Git Remote Repository to the local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/trashvin/python-gamedev-2021.git
